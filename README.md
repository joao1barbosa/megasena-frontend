# Lorterias Front-end

This is my implementation for a frontend challenge where the goal was to build a user interface based on an API. The project uses React and Typescript to provide a responsive and dynamic experience.

> [!WARNING]
> The API that the challenge indicated was no longer working, so I looked for one on my own and it presents a problem that blocks many requests in a short time through the CORS policy.
>
> The application works, but only some of the requests made. To make it work perfectly, I had to use a Google Chrome extension called [Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=pt-BR) that can work around the problem.
